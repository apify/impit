# TypeScript Crawlee & CheerioCrawler Actor Template

<!-- This is an Apify template readme -->

This template example was built with [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) to scrape data from a website using [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) wrapped into [CheerioCrawler](https://crawlee.dev/api/cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler).

## Quick Start

Once you've installed the dependencies, start the Actor:

```bash
apify run
```

Once your Actor is ready, you can push it to the Apify Console:

```bash
apify login # first, you need to log in if you haven't already done so

apify push
```

## Project Structure

## How it works

This code is a TypeScript script that uses Cheerio to scrape data from a website. It then stores the website titles in a dataset.

- The crawler starts with URLs provided from the input `startUrls` field defined by the input schema. Number of scraped pages is limited by `maxPagesPerCrawl` field from the input schema.
- The crawler uses `requestHandler` for each URL to extract the data from the page with the Cheerio library and to save the title and URL of each page to the dataset. It also logs out each result that is being saved.

## What's included

- **[Apify SDK](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/js)** - toolkit for building [Actors](https://apify.com/actors)
- **[Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/)** - web scraping and browser automation library
- **[Input schema](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/input-schema)** - define and easily validate a schema for your Actor's input
- **[Dataset](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/concepts/storages#working-with-datasets)** - store structured data where each object stored has the same attributes
- **[Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)** - a fast, flexible & elegant library for parsing and manipulating HTML and XML
- **[Proxy configuration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/proxy)** - rotate IP addresses to prevent blocking

## Creating Actors with templates

[How to create Apify Actors with web scraping code templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-i-Korzf8w)

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-locally). To run the Actor use the following command:

```bash
apify run
```

## Deploy to Apify

### Connect Git repository to Apify

If you've created a Git repository for the project, you can easily connect to Apify:

1. Go to [Actor creation page](https://console.apify.com/actors/new)
2. Click on **Link Git Repository** button

### Push project on your local machine to Apify

You can also deploy the project on your local machine to Apify without the need for the Git repository.

1. Log in to Apify. You will need to provide your [Apify API Token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) to complete this action.

    ```bash
    apify login
    ```

2. Deploy your Actor. This command will deploy and build the Actor on the Apify Platform. You can find your newly created Actor under [Actors -> My Actors](https://console.apify.com/actors?tab=my).

    ```bash
    apify push
    ```
